# Feature Toggle in React (example)

A React app bootstrapped with `create-react-app`. I am using this project to show how you can quickly implement a feature toggle and deploy it to production.

## How to run (development mode)

1. Install dependencies and start a dev server

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can open the app in your browser (http://localhost:3000/)
